My first self-directed data project.

The goal is to evaluate the lyrics of the top 10 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 over the last 50 years and get the average number of unique words in the lyrics for each, then determine if there is a trend over time.

You will need a Genius API account and access token if you wish to run the lyrics fetcher.
